# Tokenization-Chris Potts tokenizer
# Feature extraction = WSD(pywsd library using simple_lesk method)
#Additions:
#1. Intensifiers, Diminishers, Negators
#2. Negators in sentiwordnet lexicon -> imcorporate their scores
#3. negators not in sentiwordnet lexicon -> negate the signs 
#4  convert 's' pos to 'a' for matching in sentiwordnet lexicon
#5. using a 2-gram approach
#6. Ignoring text in braces
#7. Ignoring stopwords and negator words from the evaluation
#8. Ignoring words having high objectivity value(i.e. >=0.9)
